Group 3 project for STAT400 @ CSU

# Group members
Cameryn Manley, Alaina Cross, and Sarah Denison

# Project Summary
Our group is reproducing the Monte Carlo simulation in the paper, "Modeling urban traffic noise dependence on energy, assisted with Monte Carlo simulation" by Rui Calejo Rodrigues. The paper uses rate of energy consumption versus velocity, ranging from 0 to 111 km/h, of mixed vehicles from . In this project, our group will be simulating the energy consumption with velocities up to 70 mph.
